# Check-it! App

This is my project for a checklist app, using Angular, TypeScript, and Material UI. The layout is very simple,
but it's based in mobile layouts and made with colors that doesn't force the eye.
In the app, you can add a new task, edit it, check as finished, mark as priority and delete it. 
You can also filter by the finished tasks, pending tasks or all of them.

I had a lot of fun doing the project and I'm very excited to improve it later!

## Requirements

You can test the working app in the link below (in your desktop or phone):
https://infobrunus.github.io/checkit-app/

To run the project, you will need to install the following tools:

> Node JS: Access https://nodejs.org/en/ to install the last version of Node JS. 

> Angular CLI: To manage the Angular projects, you will need to install the Angular Cli. Open your Terminal and run the command "npm install -g @angular/cli"

## Installing / Getting started

To run my project, you can open the terminal, go to the current folder ('/tnn-form') and run the command below to install the project dependencies:
`npm i`

When it's finished, you can run the command below to generate a local instance in your computer:
`ng serve`

## Exploring the Form

Now, you can navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and you will see the initial page. 
The page shows a default task, so you can edit or delete it to create your own tasks.

## Testing

To test, you can run:
`ng test`

The tests are in their initial phase, but I had a lot of fun knowing and writing the tests :)
